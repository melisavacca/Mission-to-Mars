# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this challenge is to update and polish a web app.  The goal was to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images using BeautifulSoup and Splinter.  We also scraped full-resolution images of Mar's hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accomodate these changes.
